/**
 * Deterministic stand-in for random_bytes() in tests.
 *
 * Random test data makes coverage non-reproducible: a codec branch that depends on the
 * shape of its input — PackBits filling a 128-byte literal, LZW exhausting its code space
 * — is taken on most draws and missed on the rest, so the coverage gate passes or fails by
 * luck. These bytes are just as unpredictable to the codec under test but identical on
 * every run, which keeps both the assertions and the coverage stable.
