/**
 * TJXLSizeHeader class.
 *
 * The `SizeHeader` a JPEG XL codestream opens with (ISO/IEC 18181-1), which is the only
 * place a JXL states its pixel dimensions.  It is a bit-packed structure rather than a
 * field layout, so reading it is the one part of JPEG XL that cannot be done with byte
 * arithmetic:
 *
 * - a `small` flag; when set, the height is five bits of eighths-minus-one, so a small
 *   image's height is always a multiple of eight;
 * - otherwise the height is a `U32`: a two-bit selector choosing a 9-, 13-, 18- or 30-bit
 *   field, and the stored value is one less than the height;
 * - then a three-bit aspect ratio.  Zero means the width is stored the same way the height
 *   was; anything else names a ratio in {@see AspectRatios} and the width is derived, which
 *   is why most JXL files store no width at all.
 *
 * The bits are packed **least-significant first within each byte**, and a field's first bit
 * is its *low* bit.  That is neither of the orders the framework's bit reader offers — its
 * LSB-first mode still packs a field most-significant first — so the few lines of bit
 * reading here are deliberately local rather than borrowed.
 *
 * Verified against 24 files written by `cjxl` covering every aspect ratio, both height
 * forms, and the 9-, 13- and 18-bit selectors.
