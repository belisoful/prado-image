/**
 * TBMFFFileBox class.
 *
 * A box of an ISO base media *file* — an MP4, a QuickTime movie, a HEIF or an AVIF — which
 * is {@see TBMFFBox}'s grammar plus the one thing the grammar cannot know: which types hold
 * children.  The lists here are what the format defines, not a guess; they were checked
 * against files written by ffmpeg and libheif.
 *
 * `meta` is the trap the whole format hinges on.  It is a **FullBox**, so four bytes of
 * version and flags sit between its header and its first child; a walker that treats it as
 * a plain container reads those bytes as a box length and desynchronizes everything after
 * it.  {@see FullBoxContainers} is what stops that.
 *
 * `ilst` is listed but the metadata keys inside it (`\xA9nam`, `covr`, `trkn`, …) are not:
 * their four-character codes are open-ended, so a key box stays opaque and its `data` boxes
 * are read from its payload on demand.
 *
 * `iinf` is deliberately **not** listed.  It is a FullBox container too, but the count
 * between its flags and its children is two bytes in version 0 and four in version 1, so
 * its prefix is not a constant — {@see \Prado\IO\Image\TBMFF} reads its entries itself.
