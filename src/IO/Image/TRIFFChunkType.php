/**
 * TRIFFChunkType class.
 *
 * The four-character ids of the RIFF chunks this library knows by name — the generic
 * container ids, the WebP form's chunks, and the AVI form's structure and metadata — as a
 * single vocabulary in place of scattered string literals.  The values are the on-disk ids (with the trailing space a short id
 * carries, such as `VP8 ` and `XMP `), so a constant is interchangeable with the raw
 * string a {@see TImageChunk} carries.
 *
 * This is a **vocabulary of the known ids, not a closed type**: a RIFF container may hold
 * any chunk id, and {@see TRIFF}/{@see TWebP} preserve unknown ones byte-faithfully by
 * keeping the chunk id a raw string.
